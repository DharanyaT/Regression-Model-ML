This repository is for the work carriedout on "PEARL MILLET CROP BIOPHYSICAL PARAMETER RETRIEVAL FROM SPACE BORNE POLARIMETRIC SAR DATA USING MACHINE LEARNING". 
This research highlights the potential of single date quad-pol data in retrieval of crop biophysical variables. A new dimension in approach for selection of radar variables was explored. The results will help readers explore the sensitive radar parameters for crop monitoring and biophysical parameter estimation using machine learning. In the spirit of open science development, the program codes are shared in Github repository.
